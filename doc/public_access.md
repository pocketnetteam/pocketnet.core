# To open access to your node's public data, you need to prepare the node.
## Basic requirements:
1. Availability of a dedicated public IPv4 address
2. Open ports 37070, 38081 and 8087
3. If your node gets access to the global Internet, port forwarding through your router is required
4. Valid node settings to allow accepting requests to public methods

## Details:

1.  A dedicated IPv4 address can be obtained from an Internet service provider or a hosting service provider.
    When you rent a virtual cloud machine, you usually already get an additional public address, often even a static one.
    If you are running a node on a home computer, then you need to clarify the possibility of getting a dedicated IPv4.

2.  Depending on your network and hardware configuration, you may also need to open additional ports.:
    37070 - to accept connections from other network nodes
    38081 - to accept HTTP POST requests along the path *.*.*.*:38081/public
    8087  - for the ability to establish a WebSocket connection to a node to support notifications
    Opening ports may require additional work in the settings of the router, operating system, or hosting control panels.

3.  If your host is hidden from the Internet by a router or router you may also need to forward the ports
    (37070, 38081, 8087).

4.  Example of node configuration (pocketcoin.conf):
    ```
    # Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands
    server=1
    
    # Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy or -connect)
    listen=1
    
    # The service port of the node for the implementation of the blockchain network
    port=37070
    
    # Private API port - node management
    rpcport=37071
    
    # Public API port - implements the interface for accessing social network data
    publicrpcport=38081
    
    # WebSocket service port - implements the notification mechanism
    wsuse=1
    wsport=8087
    
    # Settings for the number of RPC command processing threads and message queue size
    rpcthreads=1
    rpcworkqueue=1    
    rpcpostthreads=3
    rpcpostworkqueue=100
    rpcpublicthreads=5
    rpcpublicworkqueue=100
    
    # ! These opens access to the node management interface from external network
    # ! These settings allow you to connect to your node and fully manage it. Be careful.
    # rpcallowip=127.0.0.0    
    
    # Do not enter your username and password here if you are not sure that you need it.
    # The node generates a random password at startup.
